********** PRIMARY TODOS **********

- Get the is_hidden mechanic to work, need to set conditions inside look_around function

- Decide what special interactions to add to other rooms, if any, and add them
Maybe more noise makers or items to take

- Address the weird issue where when the player picks an action, it gives a static description
even when the player has already completed that action ex. Player already has the knife but when they open drawer again
it describes the knife in the drawer. Could add some conditions or just edit descriptions to make sense.







********** SAVING FOR LATER **********

- Randomize safe code!?

- Create a monster/bad guy AI that tracks the player! - Interacts with is_hidden and loud sound/alert mechanics, and time passed
> Subtask: Keep track of sound/alert level and time passed, they can even be a function of each other i.e. alert level 
increases gradually as time passes and jumps when loud noise is made
