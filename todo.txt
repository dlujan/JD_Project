********** PRIMARY TODOS **********

- Get the is_hidden mechanic to work, need to set conditions inside look_around function

- Decide what special interactions to add to other rooms, if any, and add them
Maybe more noise makers or items to take

- if user is already in the room, the room location notice doesn't keep repeating, as well as the same description






********** SAVING FOR LATER **********

- Create a monster/bad guy AI that tracks the player! - Interacts with is_hidden and loud sound/alert mechanics, and time passed
> Subtask: Keep track of sound/alert level and time passed, they can even be a function of each other i.e. alert level
increases gradually as time passes and jumps when loud noise is made
