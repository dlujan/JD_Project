********** PRIMARY TODOS **********

- Get the is_hidden mechanic to work, need to set conditions inside look_around function

- Decide what special interactions to add to other rooms, if any, and add them
Maybe more noise makers or items to take

- if user has already chosen an action, we can remove it from the list. that way it doesn't show up again
unless they need to retrieve an object, then it can keep showing up until they get what they need to have

- if user is already in the room, the room location notice doesn't keep repeating, as well as the same description






********** SAVING FOR LATER **********

- Create a monster/bad guy AI that tracks the player! - Interacts with is_hidden and loud sound/alert mechanics, and time passed
> Subtask: Keep track of sound/alert level and time passed, they can even be a function of each other i.e. alert level
increases gradually as time passes and jumps when loud noise is made
